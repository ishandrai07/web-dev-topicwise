# CSS Size Units Practice 📏

This project demonstrates the usage of **CSS size units** such as `vh`, `vw`, and `em` along with layout-related properties like `margin`, `padding`, `box-sizing`, and borders using **internal CSS**.

---

## 📁 Files Included

- **index.html** – HTML structure with internal CSS for size unit demonstration

---

## 🎨 CSS Type Used

✅ **Internal CSS**  
All CSS is written inside the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML file.

---

## 📘 Concepts Covered

### 🔹 Viewport Units (`vh`, `vw`)
- `vh` (viewport height): Relative to the height of the browser window  
- `vw` (viewport width): Relative to the width of the browser window  

Used to make layouts responsive.

Example:
```css
min-height: 80vh;
width: 80vw;
```
### 🔹 Relative Font Unit (em)

- `em` is relative to the parent or default font size

- `2em` means 2 × 16px = 32px (default browser font size)

  Example:
  ```
  font-size: 2em;
  ```

### 🔹 Box Model Properties

The project also uses:

- margin

- padding

- border

- box-sizing: border-box

These help control spacing and element sizing.

## 🧪 Layout Explanation

- First box: Uses `em` for font sizing and `vh/vw` for dimensions

- Second box: Demonstrates large content handling with `min-height`

- Third box: Simple container to compare width and margin behavior
